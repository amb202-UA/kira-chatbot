# Chatbot Kira
Source code of my chatbot project using Google Dialogflow, Google API and web programming languages.

Kira is an interactive fiction (currently available in Spanish) developed with Google Dialogflow. To make this possible, I used the Google API to control Dialogflow contexts, send messages to the chatbot and receive its responses. To facilitate interaction with the chatbot, I have created a web interface that mimics a chat. In this interface, you can write messages to the chatbot and view the conversation history at any time.

The repository contains:
* A web interface created with HTML and CSS.
* JavaScript code responsible for the interface logic and communication with the PHP code.
* PHP code that connects to Google Dialogflow through the Google API and queries a database.
